# Transportation-problem
Transportation Problem in operational research with efficiency and precision. By implementing cutting-edge algorithms and user-friendly interfaces, we've developed a tool that optimizes the allocation of resources and minimizes transportation costs. Simplify your supply chain management and boost your operational efficiency with our solution. 
Tools Used:

Python: We leveraged the power of Python for its versatility, extensive libraries, and ease of implementation.

Tkinter: Tkinter was utilized for creating a user-friendly graphical interface to input data and visualize results.

Types of Problem:

Transportation Problem: This classic operational research problem involves optimizing the distribution of goods from multiple suppliers to multiple consumers while minimizing transportation costs. Our project effectively addresses and solves this logistical challenge.

Three Types of Approaches are done:
1. Least Cell Method
2. North-west Method
3. VAM method
